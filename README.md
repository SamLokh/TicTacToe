# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game. Both 1 player mode (against computer) and 2 player mode are supported. You can track the score across a number of rounds. One of the first project that I did after getting into programming (at level=Novice), so might not be that efficient and I'm too lazy now to go back and make it efficient. But the game (program) WORKS!


There is a bug in 1 (single) player mode: 

After the computer blocks your winning move, i.e. suppose positions 1 and 2 are yours, so the computer blocks position 3 (which is your winning position), but if you select that same position 3 in your next turn, you'll be able to select that position and therefore win.
(I'm too lazy to revisit that old program and fix it).
