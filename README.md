# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game. Both 1 player mode (against computer) and 2 player mode are supported. You can track the score across a number of rounds. One of the first project that I did after getting into programming, so might not be that efficient and I'm too lazy now to go back and make it efficient. But the game (program) WORKS!
